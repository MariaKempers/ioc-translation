## What
### Interlinking all digital forms of value

<span class="column-left">
<a href="https://internetofcoins.org" target="_blank">Internet of Coins</a> is an environment for personal finance. As a decentralized platform it enables an optimally inclusive financial network, interlinking all digital forms of value. It allows you to trade digital assets and currencies peer to peer, with an easy to use interface and the opportunity to earn fees by participating as an allocator.<br><br>In the past two years, the groundwork for this system has been implemented by a team that dedicates their time to the creation of an innovative open source financial networking agent called <a href="https://github.com/internetofcoins/hybridd" target="_blank"><i>hybridd</i></a>, that directly links crypto-ledgers together.

<b>Existing wallets need no changes or adaptations to allow their blockchains and value systems to be hooked into this autonomous decentralized network.</b><br><br>We want to integrate all token value systems into an interconnected and financially liquid web. The current developments in cryptocurrencies are already overflowing with creativity, and we'd love to see these developments continue without imposing any artificial or technical limitations.
