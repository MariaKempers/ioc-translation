# ioc-translation

Every page of our site sits in a folder on https://github.org/ioc-translator/ioc-translation, and inside this folder are the folders for the different parts of that page.

Add a translation option by copying mypage.en.md to mypage.XY.md 

(Where XY is the language code of your translated country/language, e.g. ru for Russion, cn for Chinese, etc.)

(I sent you all the steps 1-10 in screenshots to robs email account. Will also forward to the translation gmail account.)

When a translator shows up for the job, create an issue that refers to the language or file that has to be translated and assign this issue to a translator explicitly in the issue. This will be our official assignment of a translation to a certain translator. 

Example issue text: Translate English to Russian (all .ru.md files) appointed to @Russki

(They need to create their own free github account and give you their github nickname, so you can allow them into the translation repo. The @Russki makes sure Russki is notified of the issue on his email account - the one (s)he linked to github.)

Once the translation is done, the translator comments on the issue saying: "I'm done for review"

When the editor (you) approves the translation, you can close the issue.
